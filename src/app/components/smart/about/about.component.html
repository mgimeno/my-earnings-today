<h2>Calculations</h2>

<p>
  <b>If your salary is per month or year:</b>
  <br /><br />
  This means that you earn the same amount monthly and yearly regardless of the number of working days in the current
  month or year.
  <br /><br />
  However, you earn a different amount hourly, daily and weekly depending on how many working days there are in the
  current month or year.
  <br /><br />
  The fewer working days in a month, the more you are earning per hour, day and week during that month.
</p>

<p>
  <b>If your salary is per hour, day or week:</b>
  <br /><br />
  This means that you earn depending on the hours, days or weeks that you work.
  <br /><br />
  Therefore, the amount earned monthly and annually will vary depending on the number of working days in the current
  month or year.
